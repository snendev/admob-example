# Bevy Admob Example

This is an example repo showing how to integrate Google Admob with a Bevy project.

It is ultimately built off (a fork of) NiklasEi's [Bevy Game Template](https://github.com/niklasEi/bevy_game_template).

This README is WIP and should eventually point to a writeup on how this works + how to extend it.
